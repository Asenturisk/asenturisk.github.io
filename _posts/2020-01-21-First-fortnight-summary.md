Hey, How are you doing? Its been 21 days since I wrote my first blog. I should have written this a litle earlier. Anyways...

I had to travel to chennai due to some medical emergency. Stayed there for two weeks. Good that company allowed me to work from there. Although I did not notice any lack on my work, my personal planning impacted for sure. The situation came out of nowhere and I think I adapted well.

I started playing cricket after 4 years. I have played two matches so far, my performance hasn't been really good but it's way better than not playing at all.
You can track my cricket profile [here][bikramCricHero].

Could not run regularly. Just went for 2 runs. Partly because I was really busy. Also, I played a lot of cricket during the weekends and I was not feeling good enough to run. But definitely could have gone for more runs.

I went to a GraphQL meetup last weekend. Learnt some graphql concepts. Also have done some hobby project. Would like to work with subscription and real-time data. Thinking of creating a chat app. Lets see.

Went through core and some advance topics of Typescript. Read up stuff on Clean-code. Learnt some accessibility principles. Would be building out something next week with those principles.

I found out some more things about me. Found that, I don't feel comfortable sharing or taking pictures. It is somekind of psychological barrier, I shall be working to break. Uploaded profile on most of the private mediums. Need to set profile picture on public facing medium.

During my last match, while we were waiting for the match to start, there was a guy from another team smoking inside the pavilion. Thought of asking him to go outside but didn't (maybe couldn't, was tempted to ask). One guy actually asked him to smoke outside. It went well. We need more of those guys. At least, I need to stand up. Will be taking those responsibilities going forward.
